// Encoder is the basic interface proposed for the stream encoder component for
// DECODE. It currently just exposes two methods which allow for encoded streams
// to be created and destroyed. Creating a stream means setting up a
// subscription to an MQTT broker such that we start receiving events for a
// specific device. These events are then encrypted using the supplied
// credentials, and then written upstream to our encrypted datastore. Once a
// stream has been created it continues running indefinitely until receiving a
// call to delete the stream.
//
// Later iterations of this service will implement filtering and aggregation
// operations on the stream, but for now all data is simply passed through to
// the datastore.

  // subscribe to the specified MQTT topic, save the encryption keys, and start

  // we encrypt the contents using Zenroom and then write the encrypted data to
  // the configured datastore.
